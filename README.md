# GIPHY-API

Deployed at: https://thawing-plains-13142.herokuapp.com/

A silly app using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to allow the user to search for a GIF.

The input request will create a button with that name.

When the button is clicked, the script will hit the GIPHY API and return 10 results.




Enjoy!
