# GIPHY-API

<<<<<<< HEAD
Deployed at: 

A silly app using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to allow the user to search for a GIF.

The input request will create a button with that name.

When the button is clicked, the script will hit the GIPHY API and return 10 results.




Enjoy!

Accepts user input to create a button that will make a call to the GIPHY API and display results.
